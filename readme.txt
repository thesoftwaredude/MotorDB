I started this project so that I can keep on learning. 

I have a sample application that I will start off very simple and with a bunch of things wrong with it. Over time will be improving / refactoring this application while learning.

I am going to start with an application that could be used by an insurance broker that sells car insurance. Will allow the user to capture policy information and vehicles to be insured. There will be loads wrong with this and over time will be adding

IoC container
	Castle
	StructureMap

JS Templates
	Knockout

ORM
	Entity Framework
	nHibernate
	Massive

Single Page Application

And not forgetting testing and mocking.
